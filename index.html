    <h3>About Me!</h3>
      <p>Hi, i'm Arlene! I'm a highschool student, born and raised in New York City. I believe that life is full of amazing things, and I try to live life to the fullest. My hobbies include reading, watching shows, eating, and my newest hobby, crocheting. I was first introduced to crocheting in the 7th grade, when a class project requierd me to crochet a starf (I didn't even complete the scarf). After that project I forgot all about crocheting, but I have recently found a new passion for it. On this website, I will share my crocheting journey with you!!!!</p>
